# texture-to-png
Converts folder of .textures from ideamaker into .png's in the same folder.

Run script from CLI, using the directory as an argument ie: texturePNGrip.py C:\Path\to\folder
Made this to use some of the textures from ideaMaker library. The .texture files contain base64 endoed image data within a csl.

Code is commented and fairly simple - should be easy enough to modify for other needs but is currently hardcoded for .texture files directly from ideaMaker.
I am a simple maker and use these textures for personal use.
